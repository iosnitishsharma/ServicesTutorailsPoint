//    A service is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations without needing to interact
//
//    with the user and it works even if
//    application is destroyed. A service can essentially take two states âˆ’
   // Started

//    A service is started when an application component, such as an activity, starts it by calling startService().
//    Once started, a service can run
//    in the background indefinitely, even if the component that started it is destroyed.

//
//    A service is bound when an application component binds to it by calling bindService().
//    A bound service offers a client-server interface that allows components to interact with the service,
//            send requests, get results, and even
//    do so across processes with interprocess communication (IPC).
